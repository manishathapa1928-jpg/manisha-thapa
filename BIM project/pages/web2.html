    <h1 id="CPU"> Central Processing Unit </h1>
    The CPU is the primary component of a computer that acts as its “control
    center.” The CPU, also referred to as the “central” or “main” processor, is a complex set of electronic
    circuitry that runs the machine’s operating system and apps. The CPU interprets, processes and executes
    instructions, most often from the hardware and software programs running on the device.The CPU performs
    arithmetic, logic, and other operations to transform data input into more usable information
    output. While the CPU must contain at least one processing core, many contain multiple cores. A server with two
    hexa-core CPUs, for example, will have a total of 12 processors.
    The earliest computers used vacuum tubes for processing. Machines like the ENIAC and UNIVAC were large and
    bulky, and they consumed a lot of power and generated significant heat. The invention of transistors in the late
    1940s revolutionized CPU technology. Transistors replaced vacuum tubes, making computers smaller, more reliable,
    and more energy-efficient. In the mid-1960s, integrated circuits (ICs) were developed, which combined multiple
    transistors and other components on a single computer chip. CPUs became even smaller and faster, leading to the
    emergence of microprocessors.

    <h1 id="reg">Register</h1>
    Registers are a type of computer memory built directly into the processor or CPU (Central Processing Unit) that is
    used to store and manipulate data during the execution of instructions. A register may hold an instruction, a
    storage address, or any kind of data (such as a bit sequence or individual characters).A register is composed of
    multiple flip-flops, which are electronic circuits capable of storing a single bit of information, which is
    represented through binary data – either a 0 or a 1. By combining multiple flip-flops, registers can store larger
    binary values, such as bytes or words.

    Registers also contain control logic circuitry, which allows it to coordinate the flow of data and instructions
    within the CPU. This can include operations such as decoding control signals, performing data manipulation like data
    loading, storing, or arithmetic operations, and using mulitplexers to route data to a specific location within the
    register.

    Together, flip-flops and control logic work in partnership within registers. Flip-flops provide the storage
    capacity, while control logic facilitates the coordination of data transfer, manipulation, and synchronization with
    other components of the CPU. This enables registers to store and process data efficiently during the execution of
    instructions.

    <h1 id="Mem">Memory</h1>
    mem is the electronic storage space where a computer keeps the instructions and data it needs to access quickly.
    It's the place where information is stored for immediate use. Memory is an important component of a computer, as
    without it, the system wouldn’t operate correctly. The computer’s operating system (OS), hardware, and software all
    rely on memory to function properly.Computer memory functions similarly to the human brain, storing data,
    information, and instructions. It acts as a storage unit or device where data to be processed and the instructions
    necessary for processing are kept. Both input and output data can be stored in memory.
    Computer memory communicates with the CPU through a structured system of electronic pathways and controllers,
    enabling the CPU to fetch and store data rapidly and efficiently. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

    System Bus Structure:
    The main channel for communication between the CPU and memory is the system bus, which is a collection of three
    types of buses:
    Data Bus: Transfers the actual data between CPU and memory.
    Address Bus: Carries the memory address that specifies where data should be read from or written to.
    Control Bus: Sends signals that coordinate and control the activity, such as indicating read or write operations.
    Memory Controller:
    Communication is orchestrated by a memory controller, which manages the flow of data and ensures that signals
    between the CPU and memory are synchronized. In older systems, this controller was located on the motherboard; in
    modern computers, it’s typically integrated into the CPU for greater speed and efficiency
