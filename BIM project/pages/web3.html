    Registers are a type of computer memory built directly into the processor or CPU (Central Processing Unit) that is
    used to store and manipulate data during the execution of instructions. A register may hold an instruction, a
    storage address, or any kind of data (such as a bit sequence or individual characters).A register is composed of
    multiple flip-flops, which are electronic circuits capable of storing a single bit of information, which is
    represented through binary data – either a 0 or a 1. By combining multiple flip-flops, registers can store larger
    binary values, such as bytes or words.</h1>
